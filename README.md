## Introduction
Potatoes are a staple food crop worldwide, and their production can be severely affected by various diseases. Early and accurate detection of these diseases can help in taking timely measures to prevent crop loss. This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify potato diseases from images of potato leaves.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of potato leaves categorized into different disease classes. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).

## Installation
